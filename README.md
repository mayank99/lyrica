# lyrica

Lyrica is a PWA that lets you find song lyrics quickly. After you install Lyrica, you can share songs into it directly from your music app (if your device supports [Web Share Target](https://web.dev/web-share-target/)).

This web app was made as part of Netlify's [dusty.domains](https://dusty.domains) challenge and helped raise $500 for charity.

As an additional challenge, I decided to create this entire thing in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS without even a build tool (unless `netlify dev` counts).
